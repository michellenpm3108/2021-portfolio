﻿Drop me a line, I'd love to hear from you! : )

I'm ...., a multidisciplinary designer based in Kansas City, Missouri.
As an avid believer in the power of human-centered design, I am fascinated by user interaction and people-based problem-solving. I approach design empathetically and focus on understanding the latent needs and emotions of the people who I am designing for, aiming to create clear, impactful solutions to enrich their lives.

I have worked on projects in UI/UX, web design, branding and identity, motion graphics, signage and wayfinding, and print design. I enjoy  learning about new tools and approaches to continue enhancing my design process.

Outside of design, my interests include yoga, sketching, coding, language learning.
